## What i learned

This was perfect oportunity for me to strengthen my skills in React and also learne and practice using TypeScript, and Material-UI.

### TypeScript

Transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript was challenging at first, but all the benefits typescript gave me was absolutely worth it.
The primary benefit of using TypeScript is its ability to support advanced features like type inference, generics, and type checking was a huge benefit for overall working experience.
It made my development journey much more enjoyable.

Primary challenge with TypeScript was type strictness. But I was able to overcome it and I think that its one of the best features, becouse it let's me write maintainable and safe code.

### Material-UI

I was able to integrate Material-UI into my project to create modern and responsive user interfaces.
It made my project user-friendly and visually appealing.
I was able to use it to create a responsive design, which was very useful for me in terms of making the project look good on different devices.

For me hardest aspect of the Material-UI was that it is a bit hard to adapt components to your project, but it was mainly coused by the fact that this was my first time using it.

### Router

I was able to use React Router to manage client-side routing. It made my project more user-friendly and interactive.
Router is must have tool for every project.

### Axios

Axios is powerfull tool for making API calls. It made my project more efficient and maintainable.
It also made managing API calls more easy.

### API

Using API's is project is really valuabe experience. Not only for fetching data but also for making project more user-friendly and efficient.
It made project more secure and reliable, while it also made development process more easy for me.

## Conclusion

This project greatly showcases my knowledge of modern frontend technologies. I am very excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.
The work process took a bit longer, then anticipated, but thats becouse this was a learning journey as well.
It was my first time using many tools, and I am confident that I gained lot of valuable experience.

This is just the begining, I am very exited to continue learning new technologies and tools to grow and become skilled developer.
